# FinancesManager

Link to run the program: https://sebastianrubina.github.io/FinancesManager/

Next up on the TODO list:
* Add 'View All' button to show all transactions again once the user has clicked on a category.
* Add a login system so that each user has their statements saved, preventing the need to reupload a statement multiple times.
* Make a highlight around the category selected.
* Allow users to add certain transactions to different categories and save these settings.
* Add mobile support (currently only supported on larger devices).
